# Mental_Fitness_tracker
I've provided a Python script that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and training regression models for predicting mental fitness. Additionally, I've implemented a simple user interface to take input for specific features and predict mental disorders using three different regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Support Vector Regression).
And comparing root mean square, R square and mean square error among the different model
