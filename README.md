# Mental_Fitness_tracker
I've provided a Python script that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and training regression models for predicting mental fitness. Additionally, I've implemented a simple user interface to take input for specific features and predict mental disorders using three different regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Support Vector Regression).
